    "Seismological data can be provided in a variety of formats (SAC, miniseed, segY, segD, wav, etc.). The format that is curently the most wedeli used in (passive) seismology is the **miniseed** format.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a binary format containing both the ground motion records and some metadata (station code, date, sampling step, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "To read and analyze these data in a Python environment, you will use the **obspy** library. It is a relatively complete suite of tools that allows you to perform a whole set of processing of seismological data (in different data formats including *Miniseed*). \n",

    "An exhaustive documentation and many examples of use of Obspy are available here: https://github.com/obspy/obspy/\n",
